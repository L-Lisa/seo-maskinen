## Development Notes

### Authentication Troubleshooting
The main blocker was the Supabase authentication flow. The `getSession()` call hangs in the browser, preventing the dashboard from loading. This appears to be a known issue with Supabase SSR client in certain environments.

**Resolution:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED "COMING SOON" MODE**
- All authentication forms disabled
- Login/register pages show "coming soon" messages
- Dashboard shows placeholder content
- Contact form disabled
- Site is now safe to leave and deploy

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Disable authentication forms temporarily
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Implement "coming soon" mode for dashboard
3. Research alternative authentication approaches
4. Test in production environment

### Environment Variables
All required environment variables are properly configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Production Deployment

The application is now ready for deployment in "coming soon" mode. All forms are disabled and the site is safe to leave.
